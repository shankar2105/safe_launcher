# Quick start
The development dependency of this project is [Node.js v5.5](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v5.5.0/).
Build [safe_core](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_core) with the mock Routing feature:
 
```
cargo build --release --features use-mock-routing
```
 
then copy the resulting shared library (`safe_core.dll` for Windows, `libsafe_core.so` for Linux or `libsafe_core.dylib` for OS X) to the `app/api/ffi` folder of this project.

The launcher can be developed/tested only with ffi with mock feature or by running a local network only.

So just make sure you have it installed.
Then type few commands known to every Node developer...
```
npm install
npm start
```

# Development

#### Installation

```
npm install
```
It will also download Electron runtime, and install dependencies for second `package.json` & `bower.json` file inside `app` folder.

#### Starting the app

```
npm start
```

#### Adding npm modules to your app

Remember to add your dependency to `app/package.json` file, so do:
```
cd app
npm install name_of_npm_module --save
```

#### Unit tests

To run it go with standard:
```
npm test
```

# Making a distributable package

To make ready for distribution package use command based on the platform:
```
npm run package
```

this will generate the package files in the `app_dist` folder

Additional `arch` argument can be passed to the `package` command. If this argument is not specified,
the current nodejs platform architecture will be used. Accepted values are `x86` and `x64`.

Example usage `npm run package -- --arch=x64`
